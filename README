3.2.1 - 
Package: ascii_art.
    Shell - Controls the program and user input. It has a SubImgCharMatcher field to manage characters and
    creates Image and AsciiArtAlgorithm instances to run the art generation.
    It also uses ConsoleAsciiOutput ornHtmlAsciiOutput (via the AsciiOutput interface) to print the results.

    AsciiArtAlgorithm - Runs the logic to convert an image. It holds fields for Image and SubImgCharMatcher
    to get data from them. It creates an ImageProcessing instance to split the image into smaller parts.

    UsageException - A simple error class. The Shell creates and throws this exception when a user command is
    wrong, and then catches it to print a message.

    KeyboardInput - helper for reading text.
    The Shell calls its readLine() method to get commands from the user.
    Supplied by the instructor.

Package: image.
    Image - Represents the image file in memory. It is created by Shell and passed to both ImageProcessing
    and AsciiArtAlgorithm so they can read its pixel data.

    ImageProcessing - Prepares the image for conversion. It holds the Image object as a field and calls its
    getPixel method to calculate brightness and split the image into sub-images.

Package: image_char_matching.
    CharConverter - A utility tool. It is called only by SubImgCharMatcher to turn a character into a grid of
    pixels for analysis. Supplied by the instructor.

    SubImgCharMatcher - Matches brightness values to characters. It calls CharConverter.convertToBoolArray to
    calculate the initial brightness of each character. Both Shell and AsciiArtAlgorithm use this class to
    manage and retrieve characters.

Package: ascii_output. Supplied by the instructor.
    AsciiOutput (interface) - An interface for outputting ASCII art. It has a single method, outputAsciiArt,
    which takes a 2D array of characters as input.

    ConsoleAsciiOutput - Implements AsciiOutput to print ASCII art to the console. The Shell creates an
    instance of this class when the user wants console output.

    HtmlAsciiOutput - Implements AsciiOutput to generate an HTML file with ASCII art. The Shell creates an
    instance of this class when the user wants HTML output.


3.2.2 -

1) HashMap:
    Used in SubImgCharMatcher (charToBrightnessMap and savedCharBrightnessData).
    Provides O(1) average time complexity for put, get, and remove operations.
    Used to store and retrieve the brightness value of specific characters quickly when adding, removing, or
    normalizing.

2) TreeMap:
    Used in SubImgCharMatcher (brightnessMap)
    Used in order to find the character with the brightness closest to a specific value. TreeMap stores keys
    in sorted order and provides methods like floorKey and ceilingKey to find the nearest neighbors
    efficiently.
    Provides O(log n) time complexity for searching, insertion, and deletion, which is efficient for
    finding the best matching character.

3) TreeSet:
    Used in SubImgCharMatcher (as values inside the TreeMap) and briefly in Shell (printCharset).
    Provides O(log n) time complexity for insertion and O(n) for iteration in sorted order.
    In SubImgCharMatcher: Handles cases where multiple characters have the same brightness. It keeps them
    sorted by ASCII value, allowing us to easily pick the smallest one (as required).
    In Shell: Used to print the character set in sorted order when displaying it to the user.

4) 2D Arrays (double[][], char[][], Color[][]):
    Used in AsciiArtAlgorithm, Image, and ImageProcessing.
    Provide O(1) access time for reading and writing pixel data.
    Used to represent images and sub-images as grids of pixels, allowing efficient processing and
    manipulation of image data.

3.2.3 -
    We created a specific exception class named UsageException to represent logical errors in user commands
    (such as incorrect formats or boundary violations).

    Instead of printing error messages directly inside helper methods (like setResolution or
    removeAndAddOperation), these methods detect invalid input and throw a UsageException containing the
    specific error message constant (for example: "Did not change resolution due to exceeding boundaries.").

    The main run loop wraps the command execution logic in a try-catch block. When a UsageException is
    thrown, it is caught in the run method, which then prints the exception's message (e.getMessage()) to the
    console. We also included a generic catch for other exceptions to handle unexpected errors gracefully.

    This design separates the logic of detecting an error from the responsibility of printing it, ensuring
    the Shell keeps running without crashing.

    In case of an error during opening an image file, we catch the IOException in the run method and print a
    specific error message ("Error: Could not open image file.") to inform the user about the issue, and then
    terminate the program gracefully - according to the requirements.

3.2.4 -
    We added the public method getCharSet() to SubImgCharMatcher.

    The Shell class needs to access the active characters for two reasons: to print them when the user types
    the chars command, and to pass the current set to the AsciiArtAlgorithm for processing.

    This new design maintains single source of truth. SubImgCharMatcher is responsible for
    managing the characters. By exposing them via a method, We avoided maintaining a duplicate list of
    characters in the Shell, which prevents data inconsistency and redundancy. That's more efficient in
    space complexity and cleaner.

3.2.5 -
    We did not change the provided code in any of the supplied classes or interfaces.
